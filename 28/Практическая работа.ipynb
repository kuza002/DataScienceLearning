Source: Edmunds  * If in a sport sedan you find a level of refinement fully appropriate to your transportation mission the 2012 Lexus IS 250 or IS 350 delivers that refinement in spades. It may lack the ferocity of a BMW 3 Series (unless opting for the IS F) and falls short of the Audi A4 in high-tech cool but the Lexus goes about its business both quickly and oh-so-capably and can do so long after its warranty has expired.

The staff at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South is committed to serving you, our friends and customers and we look forward to earning your business. For this reason, when dealing with Rick's Auto Marketing Center South you can be assured that your experience will be pressure free and that your satisfaction will be guaranteed.  Automotive Experience Richard Yow, of Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, opened his flagship dealership approximately 27 years ago in Carthage, North Carolina. Since this time, Richard has expanded his business nationwide by having a transparent business structure which has effectively built and continues to build customer loyalty. Proof of continued business excellence is evidenced by his flawless record with the Better Business Bureau, his reputation in the industry for ethical leadership and statewide recognition as a small business leader (as seen in North Carolina Small Business of the Year). Following present day operations at the North Carolina dealership, Richard vows to utilize the same practices and procedures at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South.  What Do We Sell? The automobiles being offered for sale at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South are prior corporate fleet lease automobiles and not prior rental or auction units.  How do You Benefit from Purchasing an Automobile from Rick's Auto Marketing Center South? As a consumer, you can be assured that the automobile you are purchasing has been mechanically maintained under a fleet service maintenance program since new. The maintenance program, which is similar to the preventative maintenance guidelines as suggested by the manufacturer, requires that all automobiles be timely inspected and undergo routine oil-changes and tune-ups. Furthermore, most of the off-lease automobiles offered for sale have only been assigned to and driven by one driver / owner before arriving on our lot.  What Sets Us Apart From the Others? From the moment you walk in the door, our friendly and relaxed staff will lead you through the buying process without the high pressure you find at other dealerships. At Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, we believe in clear no haggle pricing and aren't afraid to clearly list the purchase price on each automobile.  We are ready to serve you. Feel free to contact us with any comments or questions you may have.

The staff at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South is committed to serving you, our friends and customers and we look forward to earning your business. For this reason, when dealing with Rick's Auto Marketing Center South you can be assured that your experience will be pressure free and that your satisfaction will be guaranteed.  Automotive Experience Richard Yow, of Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, opened his flagship dealership approximately 27 years ago in Carthage, North Carolina. Since this time, Richard has expanded his business nationwide by having a transparent business structure which has effectively built and continues to build customer loyalty. Proof of continued business excellence is evidenced by his flawless record with the Better Business Bureau, his reputation in the industry for ethical leadership and statewide recognition as a small business leader (as seen in North Carolina Small Business of the Year). Following present day operations at the North Carolina dealership, Richard vows to utilize the same practices and procedures at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South.  What Do We Sell? The automobiles being offered for sale at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South are prior corporate fleet lease automobiles and not prior rental or auction units.  How do You Benefit from Purchasing an Automobile from Rick's Auto Marketing Center South? As a consumer, you can be assured that the automobile you are purchasing has been mechanically maintained under a fleet service maintenance program since new. The maintenance program, which is similar to the preventative maintenance guidelines as suggested by the manufacturer, requires that all automobiles be timely inspected and undergo routine oil-changes and tune-ups. Furthermore, most of the off-lease automobiles offered for sale have only been assigned to and driven by one driver / owner before arriving on our lot.  What Sets Us Apart From the Others? From the moment you walk in the door, our friendly and relaxed staff will lead you through the buying process without the high pressure you find at other dealerships. At Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, we believe in clear no haggle pricing and aren't afraid to clearly list the purchase price on each automobile.  We are ready to serve you. Feel free to contact us with any comments or questions you may have.
